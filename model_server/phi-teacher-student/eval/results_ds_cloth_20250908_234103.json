The options \"character\" and \"picture\" are unlikely to be something one would point out on a book in this context, as they refer to content within the book or illustrations, not something on the book's exterior. \"Mark\" is too general and could refer to any mark, not necessarily something distinct or easily identifiable in this context. \"Cover\" refers to the exterior of the book, and a \"red cover\" is a common and specific way to identify a book, especially when it's on a desk and the person asking is looking for it. The phrasing \"the red _ on that desk\" strongly suggests the person is looking for the book's exterior.\n\nanswer is",
