      "generated_until_stop": "The passage describes a study where subjects were asked to exercise at a specific pace on different machines. The researchers expected a certain physiological response. The options provided are adjectives that modify \"preset\" and \"intentionally\" in the context of the subjects' exercise. The passage states that the subjects \"chose the same level of perceived effort\" across different activities, implying a deliberate and consistent approach to their exercise. Therefore, \"self-selected\" (indicating they chose the pace themselves) and \"intentionally\" (indicating they were aware of and directed their effort) are the most fitting descriptors for the subjects' approach, contrasting with the researchers' expectations of automatic physiological targeting.\n\nanswer is",

The sentence immediately following the example, \"For example, suppose you are conducting a meeting and you want to ensure that everyone there has a copy of the agenda,\" sets up a scenario for the subsequent explanation. The numbered points (②, ③, ④, ⑤) provide details and conclusions related to this scenario. The sentence in question, \"We sometimes solve number problems almost without realizing it,\" serves as an introductory statement that leads into the example.

The structure of the passage is as follows: an introduction to the topic, a description of the first effect (decreased performance), a description of the second effect (enhanced performance), and a concluding statement summarizing the general rule. The options provided are potential continuations of this passage. The correct order should follow the logical flow of introducing the concept, detailing the first effect, detailing the second effect, and then summarizing the overall pattern. Option A follows this sequence by first discussing the benefits of performing alone when learning, then the potential for enhanced performance with an audience, and finally the general rule. Options B, C, and D disrupt this logical flow by either reversing the order of the effects or misplacing the general rule.\n\nanswer is",
