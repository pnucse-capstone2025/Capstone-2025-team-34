He states that \"we're a little bit unique in the Black Hills as it's hard to get lost for a very long time.

The sentence structure implies that the missing part should be a disadvantage of studying in your own country, contrasting with the benefits of studying abroad or online. Among the options, \"there are many courses to choose from\" is a general statement about availability, not a disadvantage. \"You can study with others of the same level\" is presented as an advantage. \"All the courses are free of charge\" is also presented as an advantage. \"The teacher can offer you instructions and practice\" is presented as an advantage of studying in your country. Therefore, none of the provided options directly fit as a disadvantage of studying in your own country, based on the context of the passage. However, if we consider the overall theme of the passage, which is about studying languages, and the fact that the sentence is about advantages of studying in your own country, it's possible that the sentence is incomplete or that the intended disadvantage is not among the provided options.

Mike, a German student in the US, finds American schools \"too easy\" by his level and appreciates the extracurricular activities. The contrast between their experiences highlights differences in educational rigor and lifestyle. The sentence \"Fred knew little German when he arrived, but after two months' study, the language began to come to him. School was completely different from what he had expected --- much harder. Students rose respectfully when a teacher entered the room. They took fourteen subjects instead of the six that are usual in the United States. There were almost no extracurricular  activities.\" directly supports the idea that German schools are more demanding than American ones. The other options are not supported by the text. The passage does not compare the taste of food, the friendliness of people, or the number of cars in the streets.\n\nanswer is",

Fred finds American schools \"too easy\" and \"much harder\" than he expected, with a focus on family life over individual activities. Mike, on the other hand, enjoys the \"many activities\" in American schools and believes there's a \"middle ground\" between American and German education. The question asks what Mike thought about American schools after experiencing them. Given his positive remarks about activities and the search for a \"middle ground,\" it's clear that he did not criticize American schools as being too easy or inferior to German ones. Instead, he found something to appreciate and a potential area for improvement. The most fitting conclusion is that he believed American schools could benefit from incorporating aspects of German education, specifically the focus on activities and perhaps a more balanced approach to study and extracurricular engagement.\n\nanswer is",

It mentions that in certain places, there were vertical tracks created by water erosion. These tracks were overgrown by bushes and long grass in the spring, making them look like tunnels through the bush. The passage also explains that the trick was to know where to cut off a bend in the road by leaving the road and pushing the bike up one of these half-hidden pathways. If the wrong pathway was chosen, one would struggle for ten minutes and then reach a dead end, requiring a return to the road. This implies that the road itself was difficult to navigate due to its many bends and the potential for dead ends. The presence of tracks as an alternative suggests that riding on them, despite being partly hidden, offered a more direct and potentially easier route than the winding road. The context of the passage, which focuses on the difficulty of the road and the advantage of the tracks, points to the road's characteristics as the reason for considering the tracks as a quicker option.\n\nanswer is",
