Let's examine each way in relation to recycling or reusing:\n\nWAY 1: Bring your own cup to Starbucks.\n- This is about reducing waste by using a reusable cup instead of disposable ones. This is a form of reusing.\n\nWAY 2: Turn off your computer.\n- This is about saving energy and reducing the carbon footprint. While it's a good practice, it doesn't directly relate to recycling or reusing physical items.\n\nWAY 3: Reuse plastic bags.\n- This directly involves reusing items that would otherwise be discarded, which is the core idea of recycling and reusing.\n\nWAY 4: Use recycled paper in the bathroom.\n- This is about using products made from recycled materials, which is a form of recycling.\n\nWAY 5: Plant a tree.\n- This is about reforestation and improving the environment, which is a form of recycling natural resources (trees) into something beneficial for the planet.\n\nBased on this analysis, Ways 3 and 4 directly relate to recycling or reusing physical items, while Way 2 is about energy conservation and Way 5 is about reforestation.
