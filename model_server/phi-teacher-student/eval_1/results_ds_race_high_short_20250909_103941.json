He states that \"we're a little bit unique in the Black Hills as it's hard to get lost for a very long time.

The sentence structure implies that the missing part should be a disadvantage of studying in your own country, contrasting with the benefits of studying abroad or online. Among the options, \"there are many courses to choose from\" is a general statement about availability, not a disadvantage. \"You can study with others of the same level\" is presented as an advantage. \"All the courses are free of charge\" is also presented as an advantage. \"The teacher can offer you instructions and practice\" is presented as an advantage of studying in your country. Therefore, none of the provided options directly fit as a disadvantage of studying in your own country, based on the context of the passage. However, if we consider the overall theme of the passage, which is about studying languages, and the fact that the sentence is about advantages of studying in your own country, it's possible that the sentence is incomplete or that the intended disadvantage is not among the provided options.

Mike, a German student in the US, finds American schools \"too easy\" by his level and appreciates the extracurricular activities. The contrast between their experiences highlights differences in educational rigor and lifestyle. The sentence \"Fred knew little German when he arrived, but after two months' study, the language began to come to him. School was completely different from what he had expected --- much harder. Students rose respectfully when a teacher entered the room. They took fourteen subjects instead of the six that are usual in the United States. There were almost no extracurricular  activities.\" directly supports the idea that German schools are more demanding than American ones. The other options are not supported by the text. The passage does not compare the taste of food, the friendliness of people, or the number of cars in the streets.\n\nanswer is",

Fred finds American schools \"too easy\" and \"much harder\" than he expected, with a focus on family life over individual activities. Mike, on the other hand, enjoys the \"many activities\" in American schools and believes there's a \"middle ground\" between American and German education. The question asks what Mike thought about American schools after experiencing them. Given his positive remarks about activities and the search for a \"middle ground,\" it's clear that he did not criticize American schools as being too easy or inferior to German ones. Instead, he found something to appreciate and a potential area for improvement. The most fitting conclusion is that he believed American schools could benefit from incorporating aspects of German education, specifically the focus on activities and perhaps a more balanced approach to study and extracurricular engagement.\n\nanswer is",

To find the speed, we divide the distance by the time period. The distance is 70 km, and the time period is one year. Therefore, the speed is 70 km per year. Among the given options, only one correctly represents this speed.\n\nanswer is",

It states that \"almost 50% of women in the United States work outside the home\" and that \"in the United States, working wives do about 75% of the housework.\" The passage also explains that many husbands want to help but often fail, leading to the wives doing the housework themselves. This information directly supports the idea that working wives do most of the housework. The other options are either too general or not directly supported by the text. For example, while women *want* to work outside the home, the passage focuses on the consequences and challenges of this. The passage also states that husbands *do not* do as much housework as their wives, and it does *not* state that women *do not* like to stay at home with their families, but rather that they seek a break from it.\n\nanswer is",
