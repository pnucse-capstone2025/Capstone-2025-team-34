The researchers trained sheep to recognize and distinguish between faces, and their brain activity indicated a capacity for long-term memory. The findings suggest that sheep possess a significant level of cognitive ability, particularly in memory and recognition, which contrasts with their common portrayal as simple creatures. The quote from Kendrick, \"What is the point of having a system for remembering anything else,\" further emphasizes the researchers' discovery of sheep's mental capabilities. Therefore, the passage conveys that scientists have gained substantial insights into sheep's intelligence.\n\nanswer is",

The context of the passage, which discusses a new water-saving system in a university bathhouse, suggests that the system is designed to limit water usage. The phrase \"you cannot buy extra time on the ID card\" indicates a restriction on extending the shower duration beyond what is initially paid for. This restriction is a deliberate part of the system's design to promote water conservation. The options provided are fractions, and the sentence implies a significant or defining characteristic of the system. The most logical completion, given the context of a system designed to save water and the mention of a restriction, is a statement about the system's inability to allow for extensions, which is a fundamental rule.\n\nanswer is",

The solution is presented as a shoe that \"grows with the child.\" The passage then details the design and functionality of the shoe, including its growth mechanisms and materials. The final section recounts the inspiration for the shoe, stemming from an observation of a child's ill-fitting shoes in Kenya. The focus of the passage is on the *how* and *why* behind the shoe's creation and its intended impact.

It states that shoppers are cutting back on purchases and that this conservative behavior is likely to persist even if the economy improves. The report predicts flat retail sales growth and highlights the struggles of discount department stores and supermarkets. It also mentions that sales of clothes are expected to rebound in 2010 but will be the hardest hit and slowest to recover. The passage does not provide information to support the idea that bigger shops will be more successful, nor does it suggest that supermarkets do better than super centers. While some consumers may suffer from the crisis, the report focuses on the *shifting behaviors* and *retail strategies* rather than the *extent of suffering*. The most consistent theme is the continued conservative shopping habits and the challenges faced by certain retail sectors.\n\nanswer is",

The specific action of replacing 50 million square feet of lawns with drought-tolerant plants is directly linked to the need to conserve water. The other options do not align with the context of addressing a drought and reducing water consumption. \"To get rid of dry grass\" is too general, \"To develop the land for water storage\" is not mentioned, and \"To grow plants that can block rainstorms\" is nonsensical in this context.\n\nanswer is",

The specific actions mentioned include limiting outdoor lawn watering to two days per week, prohibiting watering during rainstorms and for two days after, and raising water prices to discourage excessive use. The question asks what Californians should do according to the new order. The options provided are: A) Water their lawns every three or four days, B) Avoid watering their lawns before rainstorms, C) Take mandatory lessons on water conservation, and D) Keep the emergency rules for water use in mind. Option B directly reflects the stated restrictions in the passage, specifically the prohibition of watering lawns during rainstorms and for two days afterwards, which aligns with the broader goal of water conservation.\n\nanswer is",

It questions whether job variety, freedom of choice, or the worker's contribution to the final product are the most effective. The final section addresses the relationship between money and productivity, suggesting that workers might desire more money because their work is boring, and that making jobs more interesting could reduce the demand for higher pay or shorter hours. The passage implies that intrinsic motivation, derived from the work itself, is a key factor in productivity.

It states that this machinery must be used in a fixed way, which directly contradicts the idea of giving workers freedom to do their job in their own way. The sentence in question, \"the machinery is so complex that it should be fixed,\" implies that the machinery is not functioning correctly and needs repair. This would inherently limit the worker's freedom to operate it in their own way, as they would be focused on fixing the machine rather than the task at hand. Therefore, the complexity and need for fixing the machinery is the reason why a worker cannot have freedom in doing the job in their own way.\n\nanswer is",
