The phrase \"밑줄 친 부분이 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?\" translates to \"The part that is underlined refers to something that is different from the rest.\" Without the actual underlined text, we must infer the most likely intended contrast.

This inability to compete is attributed to larger global causes, such as the capitalist mode of production. The options provided offer different outcomes for these agriculturalists. Option A suggests a loss of control over their own production, which aligns with the idea that they are being pushed out of the market by more advanced players. Option B implies a turn to technology, but the passage states that those *remaining* in agriculture are *not* benefiting from technological advances, suggesting they are not actively seeking or adopting them. Option C implies a direct challenge to the capitalist system, which is not explicitly stated as the primary reason for their inability to compete. Option D suggests a reduction in involvement in cash crops, but the passage actually describes a shift towards growing export crops at the expense of staple food production. Option E, however, implies a return to competitiveness, which is contradicted by the passage's assertion that the vast majority are *incapable* of competing.

The structure of the passage is as follows: an introduction to the topic, a description of the first effect (decreased performance), a description of the second effect (enhanced performance), and a concluding statement summarizing the general rule. The options provided are potential continuations of this passage. The correct order should follow the logical flow of introducing the concept, detailing the first effect, detailing the second effect, and then summarizing the overall pattern. Option A follows this sequence by first discussing the benefits of performing alone when learning, then the potential for enhanced performance with an audience, and finally the general rule. Options B, C, and D disrupt this logical flow by either reversing the order of the effects or misplacing the general rule.\n\nanswer is",
