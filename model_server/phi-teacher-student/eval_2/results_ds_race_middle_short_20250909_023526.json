The sentence in question is a realization that is likely to follow from this personal growth and a desire to overcome his shyness. Among the options, \"he can't speak English well\" is the most direct and consistent reason for his initial lack of engagement with clubs and his subsequent realization about the value of being part of a club. The other options, while potentially true, are not as directly supported by the text as the reason for his initial shyness and the subsequent realization.\n\nanswer is",
