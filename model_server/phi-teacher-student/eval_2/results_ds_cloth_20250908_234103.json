The subsequent action, \"she quietly set the box aside and reached for another,\" suggests an alternative course of action that avoids making Jeremy feel ashamed. The conjunction that best connects these two clauses, showing that the second action was taken *despite* the initial desire to avoid shame, or *in order to* avoid making Jeremy feel ashamed, is \"but.\" \"But\" effectively links the avoidance of making Jeremy feel ashamed with the quiet, perhaps slightly evasive, action of setting the box aside.\n\nanswer is",
