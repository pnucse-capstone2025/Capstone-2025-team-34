The other options, however, directly reflect the central themes of the passage: Jeff's current educational pursuit and his future career aspiration (A), the charitable use of donations (B), and the inspirational message that people can achieve their goals regardless of their circumstances (C).

The statement about wearing out five plastic legs is a specific instance of his journey, but it doesn't capture the overarching narrative of his resilience and determination.\n\nanswer is",
