The question asks what people *can* do when woken during the first five stages of sleep (NREM), which are not associated with dreaming. The passage states that only 7% of people woken during NREM could describe a dream, implying that the vast majority (93%) could not. The sentence structure \"Of these same people woken during the first five stages, 74% were able to remember thinking activity\" suggests that this 74% is a significant portion of those who were woken during NREM. The context implies that while they might not remember dreams, they do remember some form of cognitive activity. The options provided are: A. hardly remember their dreams, B. easily remember their dreams, C. only remember their dreams, D. partly remember their thinking activity. Given the 7% who can remember dreams during NREM and the 74% who remember thinking activity, the most fitting completion of the sentence is that they \"hardly remember their dreams\" when woken during NREM, as this aligns with the low percentage of dream recall in that stage.\n\nanswer is",

The final sentence, \"In other words, until they have missed out one complete 90-minute sleep period,\" implies a disruption to the normal sleep cycle. The preceding sentences detail the 90-minute cycle and the stages within it. Waking during the first five stages (NREM) or during REM can affect sleep quality. The phrase \"find it impossible to get to sleep again for at least an hour and a half\" directly relates to a disruption in the sleep cycle, specifically missing a full cycle. This disruption is most directly caused by waking during the REM stage or the transition into it, which is part of the 90-minute cycle.

The question asks which statement is *not* wrong. Let's examine each option in light of the passage:\n\nA. \"you don't have to accept the food a Chinese host places on your plate\" – This directly contradicts Step 2, which advises accepting food from the center of the table and respecting the communal chopsticks/spoons. Therefore, this statement is wrong.\n\nB. \"a skewer is also a commonly used tool at a Chinese table\" – The passage explicitly states not to \"skewer it\" with chopsticks, implying that a skewer is *not* a common or acceptable tool. This statement is wrong.\n\nC. \"one can offer his own chopsticks for communal use when there aren't any\" – The passage suggests using communal tools if available, and implies that offering one's own chopsticks for communal use is a reasonable alternative if communal ones are not present. This statement is plausible and not directly contradicted by the text.\n\nD. \"when clinking glasses, the rim of the younger person should be lower than",

It states that fingerprints are classified by general shapes and contours, by finger positions of pattern-types, and by size. It also mentions that all fingerprints can be divided into 1,024 groups and further divided into thousands of smaller groups, making it possible to find a particular set of fingerprints in a few minutes. This implies that the classification system is both comprehensive and efficient. The statement \"It is not easy to find a particular set of fingerprints in a short time\" contradicts the information provided about the ease and speed of identification.

Blustering's actions, driven by poverty and the need to provide for his family, led him to steal food. His refusal to participate in the search for the missing coin, despite the evidence of his guilt, stemmed from his pride and a desire to avoid public shame. The eventual discovery of the coin and his subsequent confession reveal a man who is flawed but also deeply human, struggling with difficult circumstances. The narrative serves as a reminder that people are not always as they seem, and that judgment should be approached with caution. The most fitting lesson is that one should carefully consider the circumstances and motivations behind someone's actions before forming a judgment.\n\nanswer is",
