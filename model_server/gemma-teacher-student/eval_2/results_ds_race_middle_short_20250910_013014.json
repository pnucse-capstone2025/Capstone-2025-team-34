The following sentences then detail customs in Brazil, Poland, and provide a general rule for politeness (\"When in Rome, do as the Romans do\"). The final sentence, before the question, summarizes the idea of learning about different cultures to avoid embarrassment. The question then asks what a man nodding means in Bulgaria, given that it's a difference from what nodding means in other cultures. The passage explicitly states that in Bulgaria, nodding means the opposite of what it means in other places, and then provides examples of what other gestures mean. The structure implies that the question is asking about a common, universally understood meaning of a gesture, and then reveals a cultural difference. The provided solution is \"agrees,\" and the passage supports this by stating that in Bulgaria, nodding means the opposite of agreement. Therefore, if a man knocks, it means he is not pleased or agrees.\n\nanswer is",
