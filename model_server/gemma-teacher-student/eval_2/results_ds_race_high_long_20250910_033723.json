The phrase \"at least 18 more countries\" suggests a total of at least 28 + 18 = 46 countries.

It first addresses variety of jobs and its effect on productivity, then moves to freedom of choice and its limitations. The final part of the passage focuses on what motivates workers and how to make their jobs more interesting, leading to a reduction in the need for more money and shorter working hours. The sentence \"Perhaps if we succeed in making their jobs more interesting, they will neither want more money, nor will shorter working hours be so important to them\" directly implies that making the work itself meaningful is the key to achieving this goal.\n\nanswer is",

It states that while freedom of choice is important, \"there is usually very little that can be done to create it\" in a modern factory with its complicated machinery that \"must be used in a fixed way.\" This implies that the machinery's complexity and the need for precise operation inherently limit the worker's ability to do the job their own way.\n\nanswer is",
