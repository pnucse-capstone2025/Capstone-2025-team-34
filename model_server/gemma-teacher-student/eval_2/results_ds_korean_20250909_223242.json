It then provides an analogy of animal tails as an extension of their bodies, which is a result of their genes. The final sentence of the passage states, \"If technology is an extension of humans, it is not an extension of our genes but of our minds.\" This statement directly follows and elaborates on the preceding idea about the potential of minds to create. Therefore, the most logical flow is to first present the general idea of technology as an extension of human consciousness, then provide an example of animal tails, and finally, address the flaw in the animal analogy to reinforce the main point about the extension of consciousness.\n\nanswer is",
