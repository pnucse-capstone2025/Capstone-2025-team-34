The provided ways offer specific actions to achieve this goal. Let's analyze how each way contributes to reducing these harmful gases:\n\n*   **Way 1 (Bring your own cup):** The primary effect is reducing waste and the need for new paper products, which indirectly impacts the energy and resource consumption associated with manufacturing and disposal.\n*   **Way 2 (Turn off computer/monitor):** This directly addresses the reduction of energy consumption, which is a significant contributor to greenhouse gases.\n*   **Way 3 (Reuse plastic bags/ oil for plastic bags):** Reusing items and reducing the demand for new plastic products directly impacts the amount of oil extracted and processed, thereby lowering the overall impact on climate change.\n*   **Way 4 (Use recycled paper/ plant trees):**Recycled paper uses less energy and resources compared to new paper, and planting trees directly absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere.\n\nConsidering the overall theme of reducing greenhouse gases, the most encompassing statement that reflects the positive impact of these changes is that they \"all produce less greenhouse gases as a result.\"\n\nanswer is",
