      "The passage discusses self-evaluation maintenance, focusing on how people shift between reflection and comparison to maintain positive self-views. The examples provided, like the friend's winning goal, illustrate a situation where one person's success is perceived as a positive association for themselves, even if not directly related to their own skill. The core idea is that by linking our own self-worth to others' achievements in non-essential ways, we can still experience self- enhancement. Therefore, the most fitting summary of this process is that people can maintain positive self-views by connecting their own achievements to others' success.\n",
