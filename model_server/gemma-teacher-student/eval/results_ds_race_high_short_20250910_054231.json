The woman states she has \"four children\" and then mentions having \"ten\" children in total. The question asks how many people Mr. Brown sees in the street. The passage explicitly states he sees \"a young woman in the street with children.\" The subsequent sentences detail the woman's children. The phrase \"all the children are wearing the same clothes\" and the explanation about not losing or taking children home by mistake are additional details about the children's situation. The core information about the children's number is \"four\" and then a total of \"ten\" for the family. The question asks how many children Mr. Brown sees. Considering the passage, Mr. Brown would see the initial four children, and then, if he were to observe the entire family (which is implied by the context of the mother's statement about having ten children), he would see all ten. However, the question is a bit illogical as it asks about what he \"sees in all\" when he already knows there are children. Let's re-examine the passage. The woman has four children.
